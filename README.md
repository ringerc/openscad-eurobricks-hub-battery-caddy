# 9V battery caddy for use with Lego速 Powered Up!速 Hub 88009

A 3D-printable 9V battery caddy compatible with Lego速 Powered Up!速 Hub 88009.

**This is not a clone or duplicate of any Lego product or design. It is an
entirely original design that replaces the 6xAAA battery holder in the Lego
Powered Up hub with something more sensible.** Read this description before you

The caddy is intended for use with 9V (PP3) form factor Li-ion USB-rechargeable
battery packs. These packs are now widely available.

Unlike traditional NiMH batteries, these packs generally continue to deliver a
steady 9V until their low-voltage cut-off trips and they shut off. So the hub
won't complain about low batteries and refuse to work as soon as the battery is
half discharged. They're convenient to recharge using a micro-USB cable. They
(should) integrate all the annoying control circiutry for charge control,
voltage buck/boost, overcharge protection, overcurrent protection, undervoltage
protection, etc. And they're fairly cheap, wheras buying the ICs or modules to
build your own is definitely not.

Enjoy. Let me know how you go.
